// You have recently watched Lion King as well as Jungle Book and have decided to take the best
// of both these worlds and develop some OOP magic. In this Lion King x Jungle Book world of ours, Lions have two characteristics:
// 1) they are friendly;
// 2) they are in the Lion King
// Lions also have certain behavior, namely they roar and say 'Hakuna Matata'

// Tigers, likewise, have two characteristics:
// 1) they enjoy swimming;
// 2) they are in the Jungle Book
// Tigers also have certain behavior, namely they chase and say 'I am chasing the man-cub'

// Your task, should you chose to accept it, is to create a Liger (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liger).
// A Liger is an animal whose father is a Lion and whose mother is a Tiger. 
// The liger you create should inherit ALL properties and functionality from its parents, as follows:



// console.log(liger.roar()); // 'Hakuna Matata'
// console.log(liger.chase()); // 'I am chasing the man-cub'
// console.log(liger.inLionKing); // true
// console.log(liger.isFriendly); // true
// console.log(liger.enjoysSwimming); // true
// console.log(liger.inJungleBook); // true

// Please construct this relationship using the following patterns:
// 1) Constructor Prototypes
// 2) OLOO
// 3) Factory functions

// How you set up the relationship between the child liger, and parent Lion and Tiger is up to you.
